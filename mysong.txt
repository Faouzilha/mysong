Choisir une musique :
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
Vive le vent, vive le vent

Merci Marie pck ...
